# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  React props are properties. They can only be passed one way and are read-only and immutable.

  Researched answer:
  To keep a component's inherited data dynamic with the JSX file, props helps pass data from the JSX file down to a component as a parameter.


2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
  DOM events are the refreshing of nodes upon user interaction that is then displayed by use of the much faster Virtual DOM.

  Researched answer:
  Better put, the events are all of the different ways developer can control how the VDOM updates and isolates the different event listeners, only updating the page at their location. The different user interaction categories that can be accounted for are UiEvent, Event, AnimationEvent, FocusEvent, MouseEvent, ClipboardEvent, DragEvent, ProgressEvent, HashChangeEvent, InputEvent, KeyboardEvent, WheelEvent, PageTransitionEvent, PopStateEvent, StorageEvent, TouchEvent, and TransitionEvent. All of which have different event listeners related to their categories.


3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is oriented toward how us as humans think. I remember it having a lot to do with breaking objects down into identifiable categories, and sometimes even breaking those down into even more specific categories.

  Researched answer:
  More on OOP, is that the data within an object can be changed or manipulated by use of the methods available within the object. Functional Programming relies less on changing and manipulating how data is handled and has individual functions that each serve unique purposes and pass variables as arguments.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  A float is any number with a decimal value. Even if the number after the decimal is zero I believe it can be a float. To calculate a problem and receive a certain decimal value, that decimal value must be included in the equation somewhere. In comparison, an integer(often denoted by "int") is just a whole number without any displayed decimal values.

  Researched answer:
  Floats are used for more precise calculations. Floats are just integers with decimal values to a specified floating point represented by the decimal spaces.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
  Implicit return in Ruby means that the last evaluated expression in a method will be returned automatically without a return statement.

  Researched answer:
  Notably, the end statement is still necessary. I did see that, when running certain looping methods, an improperly placed return can accidentally end the method prematurely. In other places, I also found that an explicit return can be good practice to communicate intentions to other programmers.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable:
An instance variable starts with a "@" They belong to a class and are specific reusable attributes that stay consistent through new instances of other objects.

2. PostgreSQL:
PostgreSQL is an open source database management system. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. PostgreSQL supports both SQL and Java Script Object Notation. It powers many dynamic websites and web applications.

3. Ruby on Rails:
Ruby on Rails is a framework meant to handle fast back end computing such as database computing and management. It uses the Ruby programming language and is more back-end focused compared to React being more oriented toward front-end development.

4. ORM: Object relational mapping seems very oriented toward search engines. It seems like it make interacting with databases easier in the long run.

5. Active Record:
An Active Record seems to be a way of interact with data stored in a database.
